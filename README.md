# pointillism
Relative to spots, dots science : included spots constraints

Normal metric : x^2+y^2

Surface metrics distances (surface integrals, minimal path, geodesics): 

Constraints on the surface : sphere, donut(tore) + iso-distance

OR-tools, Scilab Scicos

Example : 3 dots iso-distance on sphere gives a triangle

Relative to CP i.e. Constraint Programming(Python Google ORtools), graphs, GPS(Earth locations, satellites best spread)
